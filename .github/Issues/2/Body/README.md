### [Question] Does logcat have a file suffix or mimetype?

Context: I know hardly anything about Logcat at the moment. I discovered it via Gedit, and upon further research, I ran into the problem of whether it has a file format or not. Right now, I am just guessing, and using `*.log` and `*.logcat` as placeholders. GitHub doesn't recognize it as a language yet, which makes it harder. I only know how to write comments in the language.

Does logcat use a file extension (eg: `Crash.log`, `Crash.logcat`) does it use a recognized phrase (eg: `LOGCAT` similar to Dockerfile or CMake) or does it use both? I can't install Android Studio due to technical limitations, but I am wondering how to identify logcat files. Thank you for your time.
